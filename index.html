  <h1 class="mb-3">Paris Hilton</h1>


  <div class="row">
      <p>Paris Whitney Hilton (born February 17, 1981)[1] is an American media personality, businesswoman, socialite, model, singer, actress, and DJ. She is a great-granddaughter of Conrad Hilton, the founder of Hilton Hotels. Born in New York City and raised there and in Beverly Hills, California, she began her modeling career as a teenager when she signed with New York-based modeling development agency Trump Model Management. Her late-night persona made her a fixture of tabloid journalism, and Hilton was proclaimed "New York's leading It Girl" in 2001.[2] In 2003, a leaked 2001 sex tape with her then-boyfriend Rick Salomon, later released as 1 Night in Paris, catapulted her into global fame, and the reality television series The Simple Life, in which she starred with her socialite counterpart Nicole Richie, started its five-year run with 13 million viewers, on FOX.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <p>In 2004, Hilton released her debut book, Confessions of an Heiress, which became a New York Times Best Seller, in 2005, she appeared in the horror film House of Wax, and the following year she released her self-titled debut studio album, Paris, which reached number six on the Billboard 200, and respectively produced the successful single “Stars Are Blind”. Hilton returned to reality television in 2008 with the Paris Hilton's My New BFF franchise, in 2011 with The World According to Paris, and again in 2018 with Hollywood Love Story. She has played a number of small roles and cameos in Hollywood films and appeared in the documentaries Paris, Not France (2008), Teenage Paparazzo (2010) and The American Meme (2018). In 2012, Hilton made her debut as a DJ at Brazil's Pop Music Festival. Between 2013 and 2017, she held her own residence at the Amnesia nightclub in Ibiza, and was the highest-paid female DJ in 2014.[3]
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <p> Credited with influencing the revival of the famous for being famous phenomenon for most of the 2000s,[4] Hilton exemplifies the "celebutante": a celebrity not through talent or work, but through inherited wealth and lifestyle. She has parlayed her media fame into perfumes and various lines with her endorsement; her perfume brand alone have brought in over US$3 billion in revenue.[5][6] In addition to a Paris Hilton Beach Club Resort in Manila, the Philippines, there are currently 50 Paris Hilton stores worldwide and 19 product lines, such as handbags, lingerie, watches, footwear, hair and skin care. Hilton earns over US$10 million a year from business ventures,[7] and as of 2017, she was paid roughly US$300,000 for appearances in clubs and events.[8]

    <h3 class="mb-3">Early Life</h3>
    <section id="early-life">
    <div class="row">
      <p> Hilton was born in New York City. Her mother, Kathy Hilton (née Kathleen Elizabeth Avanzino),[9][10] is a socialite and former actress; her father, Richard Howard "Rick" Hilton, is a businessman. Hilton is the oldest of four children; she has one sister, Nicholai Olivia "Nicky" Hilton (born 1983), and two brothers: Barron Nicholas Hilton II (born 1989) and Conrad Hughes Hilton III (born 1994). Her paternal great-grandfather was Conrad Hilton, who founded Hilton Hotels. Her maternal aunts are television personalities Kim and Kyle Richards. Hilton has Norwegian, German, Italian, English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry.[11][12][13] She was raised in the Catholic faith.[14][15]
      </p>
    <div class="row">
      <p> She moved frequently in her youth, living in a suite in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, Beverly Hills and the Hamptons. Her sister Nicky once described her as "very much a tomboy" who dreamed about becoming a veterinarian.[16] As a child, she was friends with actress Bijou Phillips and socialites Ivanka Trump, Nicole Richie and Kim Kardashian.[17][18] Her mother was a close friend of Michael Jackson, with Hilton remarking in an interview: "I grew up around Michael, and anytime he'd have a music video or a concert, he would always invite my family".[19]
      </p>
    <div class="row">
      <p> Growing up in Los Angeles, Hilton attended the Buckley School and St. Paul the Apostle School, finishing elementary school in 1995.[20] Her freshman year of high school (1995–96) was spent at the Marywood-Palm Valley School in Rancho Mirage, California. In 1996, Hilton and her family left California for the East Coast.[21] At age 15, she attended Professional Children's School,[18] and at 16, spent one year at the Provo Canyon School for emotionally troubled teens.[22][23] She then attended the Dwight School before dropping out a few months later. "She knew no one at [Dwight]", said her mother in an interview, while a classmate described her as "sort of more sophisticated. She was different from everybody else".[18] She later earned a GED certification.[24][25]

    <h3 class="mb-3">Career</h3>
      <section id="career">
      <div class="row">
        <b>Beginnings, 1999–2002</b>
        <p> After originally modeling as a child at charity events,[25] Hilton signed with Donald Trump's modeling agency, T Management, at age 19.[25] She played an ill-fated character in the independent teen thriller Sweetie Pie (2000),[17] and made a cameo appearance as herself in the comedy Zoolander (2001), with Ben Stiller. Hilton posed alongside her sister Nicky for David LaChapelle in September 2001,[15] in a shoot that appeared in Vanity Fair. On her persona, LaChapelle stated: "Paris had a charisma back then that you couldn't take your eyes off. She would giggle and laugh and be effervescent and take up a room".[26] She also appeared on magazine covers including the UK's Tatler, Italy's Giola and the American FHM.[27]

        <section id="career">
        <div class="row">
      <b>International Stardom</b>
      <p>Hilton's breakout came in 2003, when she starred with her socialite counterpart Nicole Richie in the Fox reality series The Simple Life, in which they lived for a month with a family in the rural community of Altus, Arkansas. The series premiered on December 2, 2003, shortly after the release of Hilton's sex tape,[36] and was a ratings success; its first episode attracted 13 million viewers, increasing Fox's adult 18–49 rating by 79 percent.[37] The high viewership was attributed to the exposure Hilton received for the homemade tape.[38] She became known for her onscreen dumb blonde persona.[39][40]</p>

       <p>In 2004, Hilton continued to venture into screen acting, taking on roles in the films The Hillz and Raising Helen, and guest-starring in episodes of Las Vegas, George Lopez, The O.C., and Veronica Mars. That year, she introduced a lifestyle brand, helping to design a purse collection for the Japanese label Samantha Thavasa. A jewelry line designed by Hilton was sold on Amazon.com shortly after.[41][42] In the fall of 2004, she released an autobiography co-written by Merle Ginsberg, Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose,[43] with color photos and advice on life as an heiress.[44] The book was seventh on The New York Times Best Seller list.[45] Her quote, "Dress cute wherever you go; life is too short to blend in", was added to The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations in September 2009.[46] Hilton was involved in creating a perfume line by Parlux Fragrances. Originally planned for a small release, high demand led to increased availability by December 2004. Its introduction was followed by a 47-percent increase in Parlux sales, primarily of the Hilton-branded perfume.[47] After this success Parlux released several more perfumes with her name, including fragrances for men.[48]</p>


        ,<p>In February 2005, Hilton hosted NBC's Saturday Night Live, with Keane as the musical guest,[49] and in May, the slasher film House of Wax—her first major film role—[50][51] was released in theaters,[52] to mixed reviews.[53] Writing for View London, Matthew Turner remarked that Hilton "does better than you might expect",[54] while TV Guide called Hilton "talentless".[55] Her role earned her the Teen Choice Award for Best Scream and the 2005 Razzie for Worst Supporting Actress.[56] She also received a nomination for Best Frightened Performance at the 2006 MTV Movie Awards. House of Wax grossed over US$70 million worldwide.[57] Hilton appeared in a television commercial entitled "Paris Car Wash," promoting Carl's Jr.'s Spicy Burger product, which started airing in May 2005.[58] By the fall of 2005, she had published her second book, Your Heiress Diary: Confess It All to Me,[59] and introduced another fragrance, Just Me.</p>

        <p>The Simple Life was canceled by Fox after three seasons in 2005 following a dispute between Hilton and Richie. Neither Richie nor Hilton spoke publicly about their split, although it was speculated that they fell out after Richie showed one of Hilton's homemade sex tapes to a group of their friends.[60] They reconciled in October 2006.[61] After The Simple Life was cancelled, other networks (NBC, The WB, VH1 and MTV) were interested in obtaining the rights for new seasons of the show.[62] On November 28, 2005, E! announced that it had picked up The Simple Life, ordering the production of a fourth season and obtaining the rights to repeat the first three seasons. Shooting for the new season began on February 27, 2006.[63] The fourth-season premiere of the show was a ratings success for its new network.[64]</p>

        <p>Hilton released her self-titled debut album, Paris, on August 22, 2006. The album reached number six on the Billboard 200, and sold over 600,000 copies worldwide.[65] Its first single, "Stars Are Blind", was played on more than 125 pop stations in the U.S.[66] The song was a worldwide hit,[67] reaching the top ten in 17 countries.[68] Critical reception was generally mixed,[69] but AllMusic called the album "more fun than anything released by Britney Spears or Jessica Simpson".[70]</p>

        <p>Her film Bottoms Up was released straight-to-DVD in late 2006. Australia's Urban Cinefile, describing Hilton, wrote that she "spends most of her screen time flicking her hair as she delivers lines like 'books are those things you read.'"[71] National Lampoon's Pledge This!, another film in which Hilton starred, was also released in DVD in 2006; she missed its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, protesting the addition of several nude scenes: "I was so angry I snubbed my own premiere."[72] In August 2008 Worldwide Entertainment Group sued Hilton in Miami District Court, alleging that she did not fulfill her contractual agreement to provide "reasonable promotion and publicity" for the film.[73] She received US$1 million for her role. Also in 2006, Hilton licensed her name to Gameloft for their mobile video game Paris Hilton's Diamond Quest.</p>

        <p>On January 10, 2007, Hilton introduced her DreamCatchers line of hair extensions in partnership with Hair Tech International.[74] Due to her incarceration, The Simple Life finished its run at the end of its fifth season in July 2007. In early August, Hilton signed a licensing agreement with Antebi for a signature footwear line (Paris Hilton Footwear, featuring stilettos, platforms, flats, wedges and a sports collection) which reached stores in 2008.[75] In mid-August, she introduced a line of tops, dresses, coats and jeans at the Kitson Boutique in Los Angeles.[76] In December 2007, she posed nude (covered with gold paint) to promote "Rich Prosecco", a canned version of the Italian sparkling wine,[77][78] traveling to Germany to appear in print ads for the wine.[79] In 2007, Hilton also modeled for 2 B Free[80] and introduced her fourth perfume, Can Can.[81]

      <h5 class="mb-3">Public Image</h5>
        <section id="public-image">
        <div class="row">
          <p>Much of her image has centered on her "party girl-heiress archetype" as well as her blonde hair and the stereotypes associated with it, especially dumbness, naïveté, sexual availability and artificiality.[237] The development of that character stemmed from the initial success of The Simple Life and her desire to embody "the ultimate brand based on [...] the right everything for a formula that far exceeded anybody else at that time", according to Jason Moore, her former manager.[238] He stated: "She was the ultimate package that corporate America would want to make for itself as a marketing tool, but it was already made for them. They say to be a famous person, people want to be you or [sleep with you], and she encompassed both of those".[238]</p>

  <p>Fashion and language are two contributing factors to Hilton's star image. Besides her long bleached blonde hair, valley girl accent, and use of blue coloured contact lenses over her naturally brown eyes, she developed her personal aesthetic through Juicy Couture tracksuits, rhinestones, trucker hats, oversized sunglasses, and the "accessory dog". She mimed "high-fashion poses learned from drag queens" and created what was described as the "Paris talk". For instance, she often uses one-liners and a breathy, childish voice in television shows and interviews.[239][240][241]</p>

  <p> Although her dim-witted blonde persona was a carefully crafted act, the general public believed it to be her real personality, and that became an obstacle in her career, when she wanted to be respected as a businesswoman. She remarked: "People assume before they meet me that I'm a really ditzy dumb blonde. That's the one thing that kind of annoys me sometimes. They just think because of the reality show that's who I really am. But that was just a character that I created. I didn't realize what a huge success [it would be...] With everything that's happening, though, with my business, I think people can understand that you couldn't possibly get this far being a dumb blonde".[242],</p>

  <p>The unusual nature and extent of her fame is often questioned by critics, as she is not considered an entertainer nor performer. One writer for the ABC News noted: "She's made a lot of money with a hodgepodge of traditional celebrity revenue [...] But what she's best at is being Paris Hilton".[243] Writers indeed suggest that Hilton epitomizes the celebutante: a celebrity for no particularly identifiable reason other than inherited wealth and lavish lifestyle. Refinery29, describing her, asserted: "Paris Hilton is an icon not just of the 2000s, but of a certain widely held image of what inherited wealth, undeserved fame, and American excess looks like".[244]

    <h3 class="mb-3">That's HOT!</h3>
      <section id="That's HOT!">
      <div class="row">
      <p>The catchphrase <b>"That's hot"</b> is Hilton's signature line.[245] The catchphrase is also registered as a trademark for products, like clothing apparel, electronic devices, and alcoholic beverages.[245]

      On September 6, 2007, Hilton filed an injunction lawsuit against Hallmark Cards Inc., titled Hilton v. Hallmark Cards, in U.S. District Court over the unlawful use of her picture and catchphrase "That's hot" on a greeting card. The card is titled "Paris's First Day as a Waitress" with a photograph of Hilton's face on a cartoon of a waitress serving a plate of food, with a dialogue bubble saying "Don't touch that, it's hot" (which had a registered trademark on February 13, 2007). Hilton's attorney Brent Blakely said that the infringement damages would be based on profits from the greeting cards. Julie O'Dell said that Hallmark used the card as parody, protected under fair use law.[246] The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reviewed the case and "denied Hallmark's motion to dismiss". Hilton and Hallmark Cards Inc. later settled out of court.[247]

  <h3 class="mb-3">Impact</h3>
    <section id="Impact">
    <div class="row">
        <p>In 2011, two years after the apparent end of Hilton's media dominance, CNN declared that she had transformed fame "more than any other modern-day star",[238] in reference to her influence on the revival of the famous for being famous phenomenon, and leadership in the insurgency of a new type of celebrity, whose private life became an unprecedented focus of public interest.[4] She is credited with creating the professional blueprint for this kind of celebrity, which intensified with the posterior growth of social media,[311][312] and molding what academic Daniel J. Boorstin called "an image", which "is not simply a trademark, a design, a slogan or an easily remembered picture", but "a studiously crafted personality profile of an individual, institution, corporation, product or service". Paper Magazine called Hilton "the mother of the digital age" in a 2018 article, explaining that throughout her life, "she's attracted the world to monitor her every move —her platinum blonde hair flips, her hot pink velour sweatsuits, her famous fleet of chihuahuas— and yet, Hilton didn't do anything to deserve this attention beyond simply being herself.</p>

        <p>Now, Hilton's invention has multiplied by the millions across the Internet. Everyone's taking selfies and flaunting their lives to an online audience that obsessively follows, likes, and shares".[313] Bert Marcus, the director of the documentary The American Meme (2018), echoed that sentiment, remarking that she "paved the way for creating a brand and a celebrity out of being herself and she turned it into a phenomenon," while Instagram celebrity and entrepreneur The Fat Jew, who was one of the subjects in the aforementioned documentary, credited her for "inventing the way the world thinks about influence".[314] Galore magazine named her "the Original Reality TV Business Queen" and featured her in its Art Issue 2017.[315]
        </p>
      </section>

    <section id="Impact">
    <p>  Indeed, her fame made her a leading figure in the early 2000s popularization of reality television into mainstream pop culture.[316] Vice, in a profile titled "This Is How Paris Hilton Fooled the Entire United States of America", noted that after The Simple Life premiered, "cable channels began programming reality television shows. MTV's second golden age consisted of The Hills; Andy Cohen reinvented Bravo with a repertoire of The Real Housewives, and TLC started teaching Americans about Dance Moms and Honey Boo Boo".[15] The Kardashian family, Heidi Montag, Spencer Pratt, Tila Tequila, Danielle Staub, Alexa Chung, Brittny Gastineau, and Snooki are some of the personalities who have followed in Hilton's footsteps, with varying degrees of success.[317][318][319] Moreover, Dazed stated that every "Love Island star who cashes in after the series by collaborating with brands is essentially selling a sort of post-Hilton aspirational glamour".[320] Socialites such as Russia's Ksenia Sobchak and Italia's Elettra Lamborghini have often been hailed as the "Paris Hilton" of their respective countries, due to their similar professional paths and lifestyles.[321][322] She is aware of her influence, stating that it "makes me feel so happy and proud that I could help inspire others".[323] She has indeed expressed that she "started a whole new genre of celebrity that no one had ever seen before".[324]
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="Impact">
      <p>  Despite the public's negative perception on her, Hilton is considered a pop culture and gay icon.[325] She attributes much of her success to her gay fan following, and while the derogatory comments she made in 2012 caused a hit in her popularity with the LGTBQ community, Gay Times, which featured her in its December 2018 cover and main issue, described her as an "ally" who uses "her platform as an advocate for minority groups".[326]

        "Throughout the noughties, Paris became a queen for girls who were as unapologetically privileged and as spoilt as her; girls who shared the belief that everyone should “stop being jealous”. Girls who centred their carefree lives around shopping, sunbathing and partying with their miniscule accessory-dogs. For everyone else, she was a bit of an eejit. To this day Paris Hilton continues to represent the epitome of naff; she's still striking the same poses, wearing the same glitzy gowns, faffing over her dogs as ferociously as ever [...]"[327]
        —Geraldine Carton of Image magazine in 2018
        Many of the outfits that defined her image in her 2000s heyday —Juicy Couture tracksuits, rhinestones, Von Dutch trucker hats and even "the accessory dog"— have become popular fashion trends.[328] Kendall Jenner recreated Hilton's 21st birthday Julien Macdonald dress for her own in 2017,[329][330] and she was part of the revival of Juicy Couture that year,[331] even attending their Spring/Summer 2018 presentation at New York Fashion Week.[332] In an article titled "Why Paris Hilton's 2000s Style Is Still Relevant Today", Vogue asserted that the socialite "(turned reality star, turned professional DJ and entrepreneur) undeniably dominated the 2000s scene, when Instagram was nonexistent but paparazzi street style photos were all the rage";[333] likewise, People magazine wrote in a March 2017 article: "For millennials, Paris Hilton has always been and will always be a living legend. The socialite has come to perfectly define not only the millennial fashion aesthetic, but also a bygone era of celebrity where social media was nonexistent, as were stylists, and getting papped while partying was simply de rigueur".[324]

        Hilton has been discussed by journalists and scholars interested in the role of celebrities and their influence through the media as well.[270] Feminist theorist Camille Paglia described her as a "groundbreaking" figure in Hollywood, while in her book The Bling Ring, an account on the group of thieves who robbed Hilton's house, Nancy Jo Sales positioned her as a "celebrity symbol of how destructive individualism ruled the 2000s".[15] As noted by Vice, "[w]ealthy people spent hundreds of dollars on pink Juicy Couture sweatsuits, and affluent parents spent millions on their kids' 16th birthday parties so they could appear on MTV's My Super Sweet 16".[15]

        On August 29, 2006, the mayor of Las Vegas proclaimed the day "Paris Hilton Day" and gave Hilton a key to the   city.[334] In 2015, an oblong turtle bought to Murdoch University Veterinary Hospital (Perth, Australia) to have removed a fish hook embedded in the lining of her stomach was named after her.[335] In 2017, she was one of the subjects of an art exhibit called “Nicole Richie's 2007 Memorial Day BBQ”, which was unveiled at Brooklyn's THNK 1994 Museum, by the man who runs the blog Popculturediedin2009.com.

        <p>Hilton lives in Mulholland Estates,[338] a gated community in Los Angeles, California.[339] She also has a penthouse in Lower Manhattan, NYC.[340], </p>

<p>Hilton is known for her love of small dogs, and has had a female Chihuahua named Tinkerbell among many other pets. Hilton was frequently seen carrying Tinkerbell (dubbed an "accessory dog") at social events and functions, and in all five seasons of television reality show The Simple Life.[341][342] In September 2014, she bought a Pomeranian dog, worth US$13,000,[343] and in January 2015, she spent US$25,000 on two more, one for herself and another for her mother as a 35th anniversary gift.[344] In April 2015, it was reported that Tinkerbell had died at the age of 14.[345] Hilton had a 300-square-foot home with air conditioning, heating, and designer furniture built for her pets at an estimated cost of US$325,000.[346][347]</p>

<p>On January 22, 2007, her private life became public on ParisExposed.com, a website with images of personal documents, video and other material allegedly obtained when the contents of a storage locker rented by Hilton were auctioned in lieu of a US$208 payment. The website, which charged for online access to the material, had 1.2 million visitors in just over 40 hours.[348] Among its contents were medications, diaries, photographs, contracts, love letters and a video shot by Joe Francis of Girls Gone Wild.[349] Hilton obtained a temporary injunction against ParisExposed.com which shut down the website.[350] </p>

<p>Between 2008 and 2009, Hilton's home was burgled several times by the Bling Ring, a group of fashion-motivated thieves. It was not until nearly US$2 million were stolen in jewelry, clothing, cash, and other items from Hilton that she reported having been burgled.[351] </p>

<p>On September 20, 2012, an audio recording of Hilton making derogatory comments about gay people was posted on the Internet.[352][353] That day, following the backlash caused, she issued an apology through GLAAD in which she said she was a "huge supporter of the gay community" and called gay people "the strongest and most inspiring people I know".[354][355] As a result of her remarks, Logo TV canceled plans to air a documentary about her (Paris Hilton Inc).[356][357][358], </p>

<p> In August 2017, Hilton received scrutiny for comments she made during a previous interview on the women who accused Donald Trump of sexual harassment and sexual assault, seemingly accusing them of trying to get attention.[359][360] Hilton later clarified: "I want to apologize for my comments from an interview I did last year [...] They were part of a much larger story and I am regretful that they were not delivered in the way I had intended. I was speaking about my own experiences in life and the role of media and fame in our society and it was never my intention for my comments to be misapplied almost a year later".
