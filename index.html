  <h2 class="mb-3">Paris Hilton</h2>


  <div class="row">
      <p>Paris Whitney Hilton (born February 17, 1981)[1] is an American media personality, businesswoman, socialite, model, singer, actress, and DJ. She is a great-granddaughter of Conrad Hilton, the founder of Hilton Hotels. Born in New York City and raised there and in Beverly Hills, California, she began her modeling career as a teenager when she signed with New York-based modeling development agency Trump Model Management. Her late-night persona made her a fixture of tabloid journalism, and Hilton was proclaimed "New York's leading It Girl" in 2001.[2] In 2003, a leaked 2001 sex tape with her then-boyfriend Rick Salomon, later released as 1 Night in Paris, catapulted her into global fame, and the reality television series The Simple Life, in which she starred with her socialite counterpart Nicole Richie, started its five-year run with 13 million viewers, on FOX.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <p>In 2004, Hilton released her debut book, Confessions of an Heiress, which became a New York Times Best Seller, in 2005, she appeared in the horror film House of Wax, and the following year she released her self-titled debut studio album, Paris, which reached number six on the Billboard 200, and respectively produced the successful single “Stars Are Blind”. Hilton returned to reality television in 2008 with the Paris Hilton's My New BFF franchise, in 2011 with The World According to Paris, and again in 2018 with Hollywood Love Story. She has played a number of small roles and cameos in Hollywood films and appeared in the documentaries Paris, Not France (2008), Teenage Paparazzo (2010) and The American Meme (2018). In 2012, Hilton made her debut as a DJ at Brazil's Pop Music Festival. Between 2013 and 2017, she held her own residence at the Amnesia nightclub in Ibiza, and was the highest-paid female DJ in 2014.[3]

      <p> Credited with influencing the revival of the famous for being famous phenomenon for most of the 2000s,[4] Hilton exemplifies the "celebutante": a celebrity not through talent or work, but through inherited wealth and lifestyle. She has parlayed her media fame into perfumes and various lines with her endorsement; her perfume brand alone have brought in over US$3 billion in revenue.[5][6] In addition to a Paris Hilton Beach Club Resort in Manila, the Philippines, there are currently 50 Paris Hilton stores worldwide and 19 product lines, such as handbags, lingerie, watches, footwear, hair and skin care. Hilton earns over US$10 million a year from business ventures,[7] and as of 2017, she was paid roughly US$300,000 for appearances in clubs and events.[8]

Her mother, Kathy Hilton (née Kathleen Elizabeth Avanzino),[9][10] is a socialite and former actress; her father, Richard Howard "Rick" Hilton, is a businessman. Hilton is the oldest of four children; she has one sister, Nicholai Olivia "Nicky" Hilton (born 1983), and two brothers: Barron Nicholas Hilton II (born 1989) and Conrad Hughes Hilton III (born 1994). Her paternal great-grandfather was Conrad Hilton, who founded Hilton Hotels. Her maternal aunts are television personalities Kim and Kyle Richards. Hilton has Norwegian, German, Italian, English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry.[11][12][13] She was raised in the Catholic faith.[14][15]

    <div class="row">
       <p> She moved frequently in her youth, living in a suite in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, Beverly Hills and the Hamptons. Her sister Nicky once described her as "very much a tomboy" who dreamed about becoming a veterinarian.[16] As a child, she was friends with actress Bijou Phillips and socialites Ivanka Trump, Nicole Richie and Kim Kardashian.[17][18] Her mother was a close friend of Michael Jackson, with Hilton remarking in an interview: "I grew up around Michael, and anytime he'd have a music video or a concert, he would always invite my family".[19]
      </p>
    <div class="row">
       <p> Growing up in Los Angeles, Hilton attended the Buckley School and St. Paul the Apostle School, finishing elementary school in 1995.[20] Her freshman year of high school (1995–96) was spent at the Marywood-Palm Valley School in Rancho Mirage, California. In 1996, Hilton and her family left California for the East Coast.[21] At age 15, she attended Professional Children's School,[18] and at 16, spent one year at the Provo Canyon School for emotionally troubled teens.[22][23] She then attended the Dwight School before dropping out a few months later. "She knew no one at [Dwight]", said her mother in an interview, while a classmate described her as "sort of more sophisticated. She was different from everybody else".[18] She later earned a GED certification.[24][25]
